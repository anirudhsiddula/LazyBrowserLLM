### 3. Run the Script

Double-click `open_browsers.bat`. This will execute the Python script and open your browsers automatically.

#### Requirements

*   **Python:** Make sure Python is installed. Download Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    *   ‚úÖ During installation, *check the box to Add Python to PATH*. This is crucial for the script to run correctly.

*   **Change the Browser:** By default, the script uses Microsoft Edge. To use a different browser:
    1.  Locate the path to your browser's executable (e.g., `chrome.exe`, `firefox.exe`).
    2.  Open `AutoBrowserLLM.py`.
    3.  Modify the `edge_path` variable to point to your desired browser.

*   **File Location:** Ensure that both `AutoBrowserLLM.py` and `open_browsers.bat` are in the same folder. If not, update the paths in the batch file accordingly.

#### Troubleshooting

*   ‚úÖ Confirm Python is installed and added to your system PATH.
*   ‚úÖ Ensure both `.py` and `.bat` files are in the same directory.
*   ‚ùå Still not working? Try running the `.bat` file from a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) to see any error messages. This can provide more detailed information about what's going wrong.
